Rederivation of PredPol model from: https://github.com/arun-ramamurthy/pred-pol

To-do:
- Need to see if scales are adjustable w pds
- work on modularity of code (... maybe .dat files? strees not serializable in json or pickle)
- average landscapes over time for each state (national avg does not say as much, use state level over time)
- start writing documentation
